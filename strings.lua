                This mod works for vanilla and many modded trains.
                Certain local trains receive German or English underground announcements, as a bonus.

                You can customise this mod with <mod directory>/res/scripts/lollo_trains_audio/settings.lua.
                For example, you can make it say "mind the gap" and "stand clear of the doors", or nothing at all.
                You can also add your own sounds. Just play around.

                Note 1: the whistles can only come if the train has a sound set with clacks.
                This mod adds clacks to certain modded sound sets that haven't got them.

                Note 2: to get more whistles, load https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1956333378 before other mods and this one after.
