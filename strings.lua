                Certain local trains receive German underground announcements, as a bonus.
                You can customise this mod with <mod directory>/res/scripts/lollo_trains_audio/settings.lua.
                For example, you can make it say "mind the gap" and "stand clear of the doors", or nothing at all.
                You can also add your own sounds. Just play around.

                Note: the whistles can only come if the train has a soundSet with clacks.
                This mod adds clacks to certain sound sets that haven't got them.
